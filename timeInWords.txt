Given a time expressed in 24-hour form (e.g. 17.23.12) hours-minutes-seconds, express it in words as
an English radio announcer might.

00.00.00  => "Exactly midnight"

Within 4 seconds of the minute, it will be said to be "exactly"
5-14 seconds past, "just gone"
14-5 seconds before the minute "coming up to"

00.00.5 => "Just gone midnight"
01.03.17 => "Three minutes past one"
12.36.47 => "Coming up to twenty three minutes to one"

Don't forget that 'minutes' is only said sometimes, e.g "Five past two" vs. "Six minutes past two"

Don't forget "quarter past", "half past", "quarter to", "noon"

Extension:  Create a loop to give a commentary of the current time.
